# Number Counter
This is also a simple 👨‍💻 project. I created this using HTML CSS and JS. Number 🔢 Counter can increase and decrease numbers using their buttons. You can create this 💥 using Youtube tutorials. 

<h2>What I have learnt</h2>
💫 I learned about how to use a JS function in HTML. You can also give values with function in HTML and when you call it in JS it will run as it is.
SO, DO the code and enjoy your life. <br>
