# Calculator 💫
The calculator is here. This is my special and Favourite Project. I create another repository to get domain and hosting for this.

<h2>What I have Learnt ?</h2>
I learn how to make a calculator using HTML CSS and JS. I learn JS's main properties. I also learn about CSS's advanced properties. I learned JS functions and practiced them. 
This is my best code.
